This is a practice project to create a hand detector for my webcam. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network with transfer learning.

To make the data set more manageable to store on Github, the images in the data/original directory have been compressed. To decompress, simply run the untar_data.sh script in the data/original directory. It will uncompress and then delete the tar files. 

Also, the image files in the model/final/data directory have been compressed in the same way. The image files in the model/final/data directory are the same as the data/original directory. They are simply coppied there to a single train directory to make running the notebook easier. They must be decompressed for the notebook to run. The final_model.ipynb will run without the files from data/original decompressed.
